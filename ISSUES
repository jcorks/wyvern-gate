Known bugs / concerns:



- Some time of day displays go offscreen when the island name 
  is too long.
- In battle, some frames display a previous background image rather than the most current one
- Certain locations in dungeons need to be made unique per-floor, such as potion shops.
- After leaving a landmark, prev menu is still open
- consistency with middle vs right side menus. especially with buildings
- School, choosing someone to change professions is not able to be backed out of
- It is vague when an item always requires choosing someone to use it on when sometimes it doesnt make sense.

- In topaz builds, fullscreen disabling doesnt come with window decoration and resizing is impossible
- Some abilities are not properly implemented currently.

Coming changes:
  . Combat changes:
    - When doing most attacks, you can choose whether to target the head, body, or limbs.
        . Head -> 35% dex penalty, but if lands is always a critical
        . Body -> Increased chance to cause bleed, no dex penalty 
        . Limbs -> 25% Dex penalty, but if lands, stuns next turn. 25% chance to disarm 
    - When receiving an attack, you can choose what part of the body to defend 
        . If correct, it procs the weapons defend action and reduces damage by 80%
        . Weapons have a block count meaning how many parts of the body they defend.
        . If INT is higher than your opponent, you have a 50% chance that they telegraphed 
          their attack and you know where you need to defend
    - Defending now gives you an additional block point instead of damage reduction
    - Enchants can have an "on block" condition
    - Some defend actions:
        - Retaliate: Attack damage to attacker 
        - Full block: no damage taken at all 
        - Stun: attacker is stunned.
    - weapons have anywhere from 0 to 2 block points 
  . When selecting a target in battle, party members move to bottom of list.
  . Being able to choose your starting characters. Theyll still be generated, but you'll get to choose 
    among a list. Thinking 5 per generated.

SPOILERS BELOW
---------------------------------------------------
- Story
  . You and another are both among the Chosen by the Light Wyvern. The Wyvern beckons for you to reach them.
    If you reach them, a wish will  be granted. People are selected among the entire population as Chosen, 
    but only one team may be selected by the Light Wyvern. The challenge is to reach them, hunting the Gate Keys to reach their
    domain. Beware: other Chosen will attempt to get in your path for their own wish 

  . Each Wyvern are siblings and know each other, but all have the utmost respect for the Light Wyvern
    each will monologue a bit before the fight talking about themselves and their siblings, Each Wyvern 
    basically judges your worthiness to see the next. It's all a trial.
      - In combat with the Wyverns, you never knock them out or kill them, but rather they halt the 
        fight after being weakened enough.

  . Once you reach, challenge, and defeat the light wyvern, they explain to you their real reason to 
    summon you, why they pit all these Chosen among each other: they need a Champion to fight on their 
    behalf to fight the Dark Wyvern, a sibling who threatens all the others and the entire world. 
    
  . The Light Wyvern gives you a choice: have your wish granted now, or continue on as their Champion 
    to fight the Dark Wyvern. If you choose the wish, the Light Wyvern understands and the credits roll.
    Otherwise, the Light Wyvern gives you a key to the Dark domain, where one final temple awaits.

    Before entering the final gate with the final key, a prompt appears asking if you are truly ready 
    and warning you that, if you dont succeed, you might not be able to come back.

    Instead of randos fighting you, now the Dark Wyverns own disciples fight you, fully clad in armor, 
    weapons, and skills. Once the dungeon is complete and you reach the end of the dungeon, you actually
    dont get another key, but reach the Dark Wyvern. 

    Meta: when you fight the Dark Wyvern, it's all or nothing. If you lose to the Dark Wyvern, an in-game
    Error is thrown with the message "Your soul is mine, Champion of Light.", corrupting your save file 
    for that game.
