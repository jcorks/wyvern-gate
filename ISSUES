Known bugs / concerns:
- Missing skills in professions
  . Assassin
  . Farmer
- Skills are not used by AI yet.
- Defeating a person in battle can cause them to rejoin the battle sometimes 
- bribing or otherwise dismissing an enemy from battle will not 
  remove them from the dungeon map, making them still chase you afterwards 
- Time of day is still listed in dungeons when time of day doesnt change. Need to display 
  level and other useful information instead
- When Entering a landmark, the previous menu from the overworld pokes through
- When using items, the inventory screen persists, causing a layering effect (purely visual)



Coming changes:
  . Item descriptions can have a colored tag to them. For example, the description of a short 
    sword could have added 'The hilt of the shortsword has a green trim'. If an item has 
    a color, it counts as a color attribute and gets those stat changes
  . Enchanter stall
    . disenchant (remove effects) from equip for a flat rate 
    . enchant from a list of per-enchanter mods
        . base cost + rate if already enchanted scaling with number of effects 
    . transfer enchants 
        . scales with individual mod costs 
        . takes all mods and moves them on a non-enchanted item
    
  . Dungeon crawl-style maps for:
    - abandoned castles
  . enemy spawns are ALWAYS offscreen areas
   
  . Stratum keys are pre-defined:
    - First dunegon yields the FIRE key. Enemies here do not use skills and do not have equips
    - ICE key second. Enemies here use skills (1-2) but have no weapon equips
    - THUNDER key third. Enemies here use skills (1-2) and have weapons 
    - LIGHT key last. Enemies here have all skills learned and have equips
    - Using each key on a gate triggers a special element-themed "boss dragon" 
      that must be fought to progress to the next island.
      . Each boss victory yields a legendary item
    - After the last dragon, credits and post game.

  . Each wyvern has a service they provide if you ever revisit them 
    . Ice wyvern challenges the party (for 1000G) a game of Generala. If the party wins 
      the Ice wyvern gives the party a Masterwork item with an Icy enchant.

- Post Game

- additional weapons:
  . rapier
  . lance
- Research Hall
    . Tablet exchange
- area plots for towns and cities to give it a better sense of order
- Books containing lore and other fun things
- Gambling Tent
  . Dice poker
  . others?



SPOILERS BELOW
---------------------------------------------------
- Story
  . You and another are both among the Chosen by the Light Wyvern. The Wyvern beckons for you to reach them.
    If you reach them, a wish will  be granted. People are selected among the entire population as Chosen, 
    but only one team may be selected by the Light Wyvern. The challenge is to reach them, hunting the Gate Keys to reach their
    domain. Beware: other Chosen will attempt to get in your path for their own wish 

  . Each Wyvern are siblings and know each other, but all have the utmost respect for the Light Wyvern
    each will monologue a bit before the fight talking about themselves and their siblings, Each Wyvern 
    basically judges your worthiness to see the next. It's all a trial.
      - In combat with the Wyverns, you never knock them out or kill them, but rather they halt the 
        fight after being weakened enough.

  . Once you reach, challenge, and defeat the light wyvern, they explain to you their real reason to 
    summon you, why they pit all these Chosen among each other: they need a Champion to fight on their 
    behalf to fight the Dark Wyvern, a sibling who threatens all the others and the entire world. 
    
  . The Light Wyvern gives you a choice: have your wish granted now, or continue on as their Champion 
    to fight the Dark Wyvern. If you choose the wish, the Light Wyvern understands and the credits roll.
    Otherwise, the Light Wyvern gives you a key to the Dark domain, where one file temple awaits.

    Before entering the final gate with the final key, a prompt appears asking if you are truly ready 
    and warning you that, if you dont succeed, you might not be able to come back.

    Instead of randos fighting you, now the Dark Wyverns own disciples fight you, fully clad in armor, 
    weapons, and skills. Once the dungeon is complete and you reach the end of the dungeon, you actually
    dont get another key, but reach the Dark Wyvern. 

    Meta: when you fight the Dark Wyvern, it's all or nothing. If you lose to the Dark Wyvern, an in-game
    Error is thrown with the message "Your soul is mine, Champion of Light.", corrupting your save file 
    for that game.
