Known bugs / concerns:



- Some time of day displays go offscreen when the island name 
  is too long.
- Sleeping at an inn doesnt apply the change of day until you leave and re-enter the town / city / etc.
- In battle, some frames display a previous background image rather than the most current one
- In topaz builds, fullscreen disabling doesnt come with window decoration and resizing is impossible
- Some abilities are not properly implemented currently.
- Sometimes, using items will not consume them when they will sometimes be consumed normally. Likely due to either entiering or leaving the battle state, or save/loading an inventory.

Coming changes:
  . SCENARIOS. The game will be split up into "scenarios" which have different 
    goals. The default scenario is "The Chosen", which is the current game. 
    Each scenario ends up with a Wyvern's Wish at the end. 
    
    The Trader
        - This game scenario features a wyvern's request to get 100k (then 700k, then 2M) in exchange for 
          a wish. 
        - Each day you decide whether to Explore (normal game) or Shopkeep (sell and buy items)
        - You start off as one person (always a trader)
          Shopkeeping 
            . You choose from your inv what youre stocking the store with. At first this number is low (10)
              because the shop starts small. You can pay to expand it.
        - Hiring adventurers results in a hiring wage. Each person you hire goes into a hiring 
          reserve. At the start of the day, you decide whether to have the adventurer go exploring on 
          your behalf, or have them join you.
            . Exploring: An NPC will fight locals ("squabble") and will accrue items from successful fights.
              If their health is below 50%, they'll finish for the day. You get half of what they bring back 
              (the lowest value stuff). If they die or get knocked out, they will no longer work for you.
              They will also equip items as they see fit.
        - Each day, you have to pay upkeep. THe rent increases based on how much youre making (evil)
        - Shopkeep mode has NPCs come up to you asking whether to sell or buy. Anywhere from 15-30
          NPCs may come up to you, with 80% asking to buy something and 20% asking to sell, more or less.
            . Each item has a base price, and customers will tolerate a certain deviation from the base price 
              its up to the player to try to guess that and be reasonable.
            . Haggling has up to 3 turns, First the customer asks how much to buy / sell. Then the player 
              gives a G amount with a custom deviation from the base price. If within the tolerable range of 
              an NPC, they will accept the price. Else they will request a lower or higher amount. As days go on, 
              this range will tighten.
        - Every 2 days, 5 item types will have their base price doubled (quality and material ignored) and their base price 
          halved based on current demand. tier sensitive
        - Every 5 days, tier increases. Message announced that the shrine section has been discovered or something like that and new goods are available
        - At last tier: Thieving is possible every day. Body guard assignments can be made from hirees

SPOILERS BELOW
---------------------------------------------------
- Story
  . You and another are both among the Chosen by the Light Wyvern. The Wyvern beckons for you to reach them.
    If you reach them, a wish will  be granted. People are selected among the entire population as Chosen, 
    but only one team may be selected by the Light Wyvern. The challenge is to reach them, hunting the Gate Keys to reach their
    domain. Beware: other Chosen will attempt to get in your path for their own wish 

  . Each Wyvern are siblings and know each other, but all have the utmost respect for the Light Wyvern
    each will monologue a bit before the fight talking about themselves and their siblings, Each Wyvern 
    basically judges your worthiness to see the next. It's all a trial.
      - In combat with the Wyverns, you never knock them out or kill them, but rather they halt the 
        fight after being weakened enough.

  . Once you reach, challenge, and defeat the light wyvern, they explain to you their real reason to 
    summon you, why they pit all these Chosen among each other: they need a Champion to fight on their 
    behalf to fight the Dark Wyvern, a sibling who threatens all the others and the entire world. 
    
  . The Light Wyvern gives you a choice: have your wish granted now, or continue on as their Champion 
    to fight the Dark Wyvern. If you choose the wish, the Light Wyvern understands and the credits roll.
    Otherwise, the Light Wyvern gives you a key to the Dark domain, where one final temple awaits.

    Before entering the final gate with the final key, a prompt appears asking if you are truly ready 
    and warning you that, if you dont succeed, you might not be able to come back.

    Instead of randos fighting you, now the Dark Wyverns own disciples fight you, fully clad in armor, 
    weapons, and skills. Once the dungeon is complete and you reach the end of the dungeon, you actually
    dont get another key, but reach the Dark Wyvern. 

    Meta: when you fight the Dark Wyvern, it's all or nothing. If you lose to the Dark Wyvern, an in-game
    Error is thrown with the message "Your soul is mine, Champion of Light.", corrupting your save file 
    for that game.
