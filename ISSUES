Known bugs / concerns:
- Menus often exit down too far. Ideally they should menu down one level at a time and allow cancelling.
- Missing skills in professions
- Skills are not used by AI yet.
- If an inventory is empty and an item needs to be selected, 
  a full inventory of "empty" is displayed



Coming changes:
- Books containing lore and other fun things
