Wyvern Gate
===========

A procedural, console-based RPG (Role-Playing Game).

Using simple controls, you control a team of 
up to 3 people exploring the Lohrthall, an 
expanse of islands in the sky, all of which 
consist of the remaining habitable planet.

The islands are grouped into "strata", leaving 
the highest strata shrouded in mystery.
Can you reach the top?




Updated every now and then.
A fun little test of [my language](http://github.com/jcorks/matte) 
and iterative project.

Playable web version coming soon.
