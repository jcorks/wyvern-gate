0.1.9a - e87b63e,Ice not working sometimes,Low,no,yes,looking,None yet. Keeping an eye out. Could be related to  multihit cancelling,,
0.1.9a - e87b63e,AP disappears from party,Medium,no,yes,looking,used wait twice and sunbeam and all the party AP was gone?,,
0.2.0 - 0512722d0,Quitting quests does not remove the quest from the island map,Low,yes,yes,pending,"Quests usually have an assigned landmark that is JUST for that quest, so quitting a quest should remove it from the map. Instead, it is kept on the map and has no effect when visited.",,
--,Need a battle tutorial,Medium,--,no,pending,"The battle system is one of the only things in the game that is hard to penetrate just by exploring. It would be helpful to have a ""battle tutorial""","Thinking about it being a book that you get in that initial sentamental box. The actually tuotiral will be a mini cutscene that will set up a fake battle and explain the various actions you can take (Attack, Wait, Item, Arts) and the different types of arts (Ability, Effect, Reaction)","good idea if it's an optional item you can use, otherwise concerned that replayability would be much more tedious as  a result."
--,Guild should complain in thetrader if you make too much money off of guild items,Low,--,no,Working,"Small detail. Reselling guild items has a potential of being pretty profitable. All guild items should have itemdata.fromGuild = true to be tagged. If the player makes over 10k from guild items, a guildmaster will come to them to complain and warn them. If they make another 10k, they have a 50% chance to get banned from teh guild",,
--,Mysterious crash of a battle art phantom,Low,no,yes,Partial progress,"Baph reported a crash after improving items (full report: "" error upon backing out of a item selection menu for item improvement after already improving a few items.""), but it looks like the crash is from a resolved Art usage in battle. My guess is that a previous in-battle crash occurred but was recovered from, and the art usage was waiting until a clear window queue.",Ive set up an explicit error for when this case comes up again.,

--,Would be nice to have a favoriting system,Low,--,no,Pending,Baph-board:It can get hard to juggle items in inventory. A tagging / favoriting system would be nice,,

version 0.2.2a,,,,,,,,
--,Blood's Ward chooses a target when the target isnt used,High,yes,yes,Done,"The art is meant to just cancel, so it choosing a target is a mistake",Just was set to target mode ONE instead of target mode NONE,
--,Fountains heal AP too,High,yes,yes,Done,Fountains heal AP when AP healing outside of battle doesnt make sense,Layover from when AP was preserved. All patched,
--,Banishing light marked as a BUFF,High,yes,yes,Done,Banishing light is incorrectly marked as a buff,Changed to be debuff,
--,Banishing light is broken,High,yes,yes,Done,"Banishing light both persists and its banish stacks dont seem to ""stick"" for some reason","Removing effects via a filter actually worked in reverse, so this and a bunch of others were broken. Fixed now.",
--,Intuition growing is so out of left field. Can we get something else?,High,--,no,Done,Intuition growth feels a bit too random. Can we achieve the same thing in a natural way?,"The idea of growth over time is going to be accomplished with ""weapon growth"". Instead of a 10% chance for all parties weapons to gain a stat (intuition of the weapon), now each battle has a 50% chance to proc ONE of the party member's weapon's increase of stats. This makes the accolade pretty trivial if you dont avoid all battles.",
--,"Easier description accessibility with ""keyword"" specificity.",High,--,no,Done,"For arts descriptions, often other key terms are referenced. If there was a keyword dictionary where a description work matched a reference word, we could provide a quick way to see what it means. It would be especially nice if the descriptions had a ""keyword hint"" character, such as $ which will signify when such terms are present.","All Arts that refer to effects have part of their generated display the list of the effect. In addition, any general terms that require more definition are also included (such as what constitutes a status ailment)",
--,Formal notification system for Arts and Effects,High,--,no,Done,"Until now, Arts and Effects are completely wild-west when it comes to informing the user. I propose that 1) effects have in their database a Start and End message string to let the players know that theyre there or gone and 2) that Arts have a commit and fail message string. The regularity will help prevent confusing situations for new arts and effects and how they play in-game","Arts now have a ""greeting"" and ""fail"" message. Effects may or may not ""greet"" the user, but they will always have an HUD displaying if an effect was gained or lost with details on the effect displayed.",
--,Cant back out of arts tecker,High,yes,yes,Done,"Baph-board: cant back out of Arts Tecker when you have enough money. You can select ""no"" but you cant cancel out of it.",Fixed. Now you can cancel or say no,
--,Can back out of item improving,High,yes,yes,Done,"Baph-board: after leveling a weapon, you can back out of the stat choosing menu","Fixed. Now you must choose a stat. Cant ignore destiny, after all",

,,,,,,,,
--,Reactions can still be used by people who are unable to act,High,yes,yes,Done,This shouldnt be allowed...,Reaction logic for NPCs was done BEFORE checking if theyre dead. Whoopsie!,
--,Proliferate / Proliferate All doesnt stack properly,High,yes,yes,Done,Proliferate* adds paralysis instead of duplicating the effect,,
--,Shops always contain whatever they initially have,High,--,no,Done,Shops (and locations in general) should be more dynamic and refresh their stock every day,"Im adding an optional ""hourly tick"" for all locations, for which custom ones can have events happen every hour. Shops can then use this to implement restocking. Time only happens on a visiting island. Probably will have time fast-forward when revisiting an island",
--,"Instigating guards at areas that dont have guards still shows the ""guards are approaching"" message without any guards",High,yes,yes,Done,"Aggressive landmark? check. Guards? Nope. Problem? Yeah, i keep perceiving guards but they never reach me","The scene for guards attacking is prefaced by ""several guards approach with haste"" but the check for if there are guards does not happen until after this message is displayed. This is now fixed",
--,Meeting someone in the wilderness and incapacitating them still displays you thanking them,High,yes,yes,Done,"If you get into a fight with a rando, it doesnt make sense to thank them afterward even if its funny","No matter the cause, you always thank them. Now, you simply walk away from their body if you incapacitate them",
--,Some talking instances have a greeting when it doesnt make sense,High,yes,yes,Done,BBQ interaction and Taverns have people greet you when they shouldnt in these cases,Now the default greeting is skipped since theyre supplanted with context-specific stuff!,
--,Landmarks on the map are a little hard to see,High,--,no,Done,"So many symbols, with more coming... How are we going to see landmarks? Currently, there is a ""space"" made around a landmark, but its not enough in most cases",,
--,"Items that dont have a size will say ""It is smaller than expected""",High,yes,yes,Done,Thought this was fixed before! But i guess not. This should be removed from descriptions if its not relevant to the item (the item has no size),"Turns out this was due to a failsafe of preventing ""bad sizes"" from creeping in. The default value for something that doesnt have a size is ""small"". Now it is properly checked!",
--,Fighting the Treasure Golem results in a crash,High,yes,yes,Done,Crash in treasure golem from discarding an empty hand,"Basic attacks accidentally discarded a random card, a layover from an early AI implementation. Now patched!",
--,Rewards for beating wyverns,High,--,no,Done,Need rewards now for beating wyverns since they are at the end of a shrine,They give perfect arts crystal effects (rare and epic arts only),
--,Need more reasons to visit additional islands,High,--,no,Done,We need worthwhile rewards for exploring,"Mines have been expanded to give MUCH more ore. Lost shrines can now give perfect arts crystals, which are not attainable in any other way (unless a user goes exploring-crazy). Lost shrines are now only explorable once.",
--,Soft locking with keys,High,--,no,Done,"With the new island organization, its a lot easier to soft lock yourself","For both scenarios, you are given home keys that are ""key items"" meaning they cant be sold / tossed / etc. Similar, in The Chosen, the Wyvern keys are also ""key items""",
--,Hired people dont have enough arts to meet the default threshold of cards in decks,High,yes,yes,Done,"When you hire someone, the default cards are not enough to satisfy the editor requirement, and since you cant back out of the menu, there is a fair chance of softlock",Default decks are now more stable,
--,Reactions cannot currently choose targets,High,yes,yes,Done,Reactions default to targets which limits the use of certain arts.,Fixed. This came with some other changes to reaction arts,
--,Incapacitated people can react (and cause other shenanigans),High,yes,yes,Done,Poor handling of reactions,Fixed so it. doesnt do that!,
0.2.0 - 0512722d0,Adding / removing arts from a deck can mess with the order of whats selectable vs what is visible in the deck editing menu,High,yes,yes,Done,UUGGHHH the entries in the choices list dont correspond exactly to whats being displayed after a few things are added/removed. A refresh needs to happen that is currently not happening. Should be slight,"The list of categories within the pickArt function was not cleared, so it would misreport clicks within the menu sometimes. Im lucky i came across an easily repeatable case!",
--,Wyvern keys are a bit confusing...,Medium,--,no,Done,"Its a silly detail but the wyvern keys are.... strange and they dont make much sense if youre not a programmer. Using the wyvern keys on a gate takes you to the wyvern dimension, but the keys themselves point to a real island that the wyverns take you to. Which is silly because if you want to revisit the island you need to hop to the wyvern FIRST before they send you back.This is purely from a storytelling/environment perspective; they work just fine as they are, but it can be kinda clunky","The wyvern keys should ONLY point to the wyvern dimension. After defeating a wyvern, they should give you a key to an island for the shrine for the next wyvern",
0.2.0 - 0512722d0,counter not blocking attack,Medium,yes,yes,Done,no message popping up as usual for counter; effect still persisted on fighter afterwards.,Not uh sure. This seems to have fixed itself...,
--,In-battle effect display needs work,Medium,--,no,Done,"In battle effect display only shows a simple list of effect + description. This should be swapped for a more Arts-list like display where the effect is itemized on a list with a renderable that shows how long it has, a description, etc. Also need to make sure this list is viewable for enemies as well. IN ADDITION: baphy suggested characters in the HUD for the character. Im leaning more on symbols, but we'll see",Symbols added and tallied when effects are present. Effect list is much more accessible and detailed,
0.2.0 - 0512722d0,certain effects like Stun which last 1 turn end too early,Medium,yes,yes,Done,"The logic for effect duration recently changed to better fit certain situations, and now single turn stuff ends early. Should be a quick fix, just gotta do it!",Effect turn counting is now PER CHARACTER rather than PER GLOBAL TURN. This makes effects much more straightforward (meaning Turns that This Character Experiences rather than The Current Turn of Combat),
0.1.9a - e87b63e,Cursed Summoning does not have the Cursed part,High,yes,yes,Done,"User of cursed summoning was ""cured"" of the curse, which bypasses the whole point of the art. Augh","The curse was applied /before/ the summon joined battle, so when it joined battle, all status effects were removed",
0.1.9a - e87b63e,Multihit ability cancelled after a target died,medium,yes,yes,Done,"I think what is happening is that the multihit attack ORIGINALLY targetted the dead person, so nothing happens once they died. I can have an alternate display for this case.","When hitting a dead target, currently the attack is cancelled. This is incorrect on 2 levels, first any hit effect should proc even when hitting a dead target. Second, the hit landing, if it does land, should be displayed to the user in some way.",

0.2.0 - 0512722d0,loading a new file that hasn't picked any party members yet.,Medium,yes,yes,Done,Crash!,This has been turned into a feature :3,
0.2.0 - 0512722d0,Misspelling of quick-shield id,High,yes,yes!!!!,Done,"All the special NPCs' default arts had a misspelling of quick shield, causing a crash in battle",Fixed typo,
--,Picking to accept the wyvern quest causes a crash,Medium,yes,yes,Done,Goes into an incomplete cutscene then crashes.,"the logic for accepting the quest doesnt exist yet, so for now its patched to not be resolved",
--,Seedable RNG world generation,Medium,--,no,Done,"In procedurally generated games, it is often helpful to have seedable world generation","Added! Though, the rng is used for EVERYTHING not just world generation, so it can diverge. Still, it should help speedrunners if there are any",
0.2.0 - 0512722d0,improperly placed improvement stat point.,High,yes,yes,Done,"claimed to put a stat point into spd, once picked, but the actual stat information and the change window displays the point allocating to luk instead. ",The display was mixed up for SPD and LUK due to inconsistent stat ordering. It should be consistent now,
0.2.0 - 0512722d0,Improvement number not shown,Medium,yes,yes,Done,"When improving an item with a custom name, the improvement +# is not shown",Corrected! Now both this and the enchantment count should be shown,
--,Better arts deck handling,High,--,no,Done,Baph and rasa discussion about this,"The following will be changed: 25 deck charge minimum based on rarities.  To bolster this, we need more starting arts for players to play around with. Skill Crystals need an upgrade, so  those can be ""booster packs"". Give one in sentimental box",
--,Better profession handling,High,-- ,no,Done,Baph and rasa discussion about this,Professions will now be handled differently. Each person can have up to 5 profession arts equipped. Professions acquire levels through EXP in battle and level at a flat rate i.e. 5 battles to level to level 3. Each level gains a new professive skill for that profession. This adds it to the pool of possible arts available to be equipped by that person.,
--,Profession separation,High,--,no,Done,"Some professions should be treated differently, as non-combat professions. These wont grow from battle EXP","Deciding between a couple different avenues: Either A) having all non-combat professions either be All Learned or B) Learned through special teaching instances: UPDATE: schools will be the only place to learn non-combat professions. In addition, non combat professions are more expensive to learn and immediately teach you all abilities",
0.2.0 - 0512722d0,Too many active quests!,Low,--,no,Done,"The quest infrastructure supports multiple quests, but other limits can be reached, such as the number of additional landmarks added for just a quest",Thinking about a limit of 15 active quests,
--,Prevent doubling up of professions for The Chosen,Low,--,no,Done,Just an improvement: prevent duplicates of professions at initial choice for variety,,
0.2.0 - 0512722d0,Blood Seeking targets one when it should target none,Low,yes,yes,Done,Should be a simple typo,Fixed!,
--,"After a recoverable crash, phantoms of the past will appear",Low,no,yes,Done,The backgrounds set are not cleared when the game is restarted,Now they are!,
--,Arts that require choosing from the discard pile cause a crash when there are no cards left in discard,Low,kinda?,yes,Done,normally mostly works except when theres nothing to choose! oh no,"Now if there are no cards to be chosen, it will be handled properly. This is only currently used for Blood Seeking",
--,Call Art causes a crash,Low,kinda?,yes,Done,As the title says!,"When creating a creature to join that battle, it asks the island to produce one. Bu the game's reference to the island was incorrect, and The Ether didnt know what to do with the request, so it would crash. Now the island is politely asked correctly.",

--,Walking and time passing is inconsistent,Low,--,no,Done,Time passing was made more consistent,"A real meter equivalent of time passage was made. Each step was approximated a meter at walking speed, and all time measurements followed based on approximate scales.",
0.1.9a - e87b63e,Assassin reacts overpowered,Medium,--,no,Done,The damage counts on the assassin abilities are NOT balanced despite the single-use nature of them.,"Each attack is only allowed one use per turn, which was bugged before. Also damage was drastically reduced.",
0.1.9a - e87b63e,Item Improvement check,medium,--,no,Done,Baphy and Rasa discussion happening on this.,"Item improvements now happen with base stats rather than adding percentages. They also use an EXP system which scales up as improvements are made. Because of the potential for increase stat bases, the difficulty at later tiers of the game were increased",
0.1.9a - e87b63e,Re-evaluate crits,High,--,no,Done,predicted damage of 1-2 critted for 28. Too much?,The crit damage was based on LUK too heavily. Now LUK is only involved in the actual crit chance calculation only. The damage is bumped up to a minimum of 3 and is x2.5 ,
0.1.9a - e87b63e,Error when using a Wyvern Statue,Low,yes,yes,Done,Throws an error when malevolent energy burst happens,The wyvern statue is represented by the spirit of an island individual. The spirit creation code was incorrect. Now its correct!,
0.1.9a - e87b63e,Too many enchants... Minor enchants basically useless,Low,--,no,Done,Minor crystals are too common and dilute the power of enchantments,"Less is more. General enchantment rate (such as stores) are now decreased. All minor crystal enchantments have been removed. In its stead, a ""minor aura"" was added as a tier 0 enchantment which slightly boosts all stats including AP and HP. Enchantment stands in dungeons have been decreased in appearance from ""always there"" to ""there from time to time""",
0.1.9a - e87b63e,Crash from trading with wyvern,High,no,yes,Done,None,Inadvertently fixed by other updates,
0.1.9a - e87b63e,Error when stealing from an NPC in the overworld,Low,yes,yes,Done,None,"NPC encounters in the overworld technically do not have a landmark associated with them, and landmarks are set to be ""unwelcoming"" after an aggression occurs. This logic always expected a landmark... this has been patched to only happen if a landmark is actually there.",
0.1.9a - e87b63e,"Crash when ""squabbles"" involve effects",Medium,yes,yes,Done?,"When NPCs fight each other (AKA ""squabble"") they never enter battle, so a ficticious ""fake battle"" is set up. The fake battle breaks when an NPC successfully gives another a status effect","I fixed and found the source, but will have a hard time double-checking it. So ill just consider it closed unless it comes up again.",
0.1.9a - e87b63e,Can have more than 3 party members,Low,no,yes,Done,There are certain circumstances where this can happen,Skie is the problem. Their joining doesnt do the usual party size checking. This has been patched.,
0.1.9a - e87b63e,Level abilities upgrade are miscounted ,High,yes,yes,Done,level 2 + level 1 = level 4? Huh? probably wrong order used.,Was a simple mishandling: was adding the level of the chosen card to itself rather than the one being discarded Should be resolved now,
0.1.9a - e87b63e,Drinks at the tavern heal AP when AP doesnt persist outside of battle anymore,Low,yes,yes,Done,No more details needed! simple fix,AP healing was removed from the tavern.,
0.1.9a - e87b63e,Gamblist missing supports,High,yes,yes,Done,Every entity cannot have fewer then 5 supports,"There were missing initial supports, so some starter ones were added.",
--,"When NPCs are defeated by other NPCs, their bodies go to a random location",Medium,yes,yes,Done,"Annoying! Random bodies appear in locations that are impossible, but it seems like the source squabbles are legit","Incorrect parameters when creating the bodies, x/y were given random values",
--,Infinite recursion when Wyvern of Ice takes their turn in the dice game,High,yes,yes,Done,"after they make their first roll and presumably make a comment on it, an infinite recursive loop occurs in the windowEvent handler","This one could point to additional needs to learn, but has been resolved",
--,High level enemies have way too much AP,High,--,no,Done,AP is a valuable resources that determines the flow of battle. Only special enemies should have more than normal,Entities now have 8 to 14 AP and no longer gain AP per level. This makes unique NPCs like wyverns inherently more dangerous,
--,Teleporting to another island in The Chosen makes the first frame incorrect,Low,yes,yes,Done,first frame is in island view rather than at the gate until first input.,"cursorMove modes waited on next input to apply pending window events, now they just do it immediately. Given that cursorMoves are so passive, this naturally folds in well with the rest of the program and should resolve some visual wonkiness as well",
--,"Sometimes when the battle menus resize, the previously drawn frame is kept",Low,yes,yes,Done,REALLY annoying issue. The battle rendering stack is a little complex so ive been putting it off;,Turn out to be fixed by the fix for the issue with first frame being incorrect when teleporting,
