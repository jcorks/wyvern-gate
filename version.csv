0.2.0 - 0512722d0,Quitting quests does not remove the quest from the island map,Low,yes,yes,pending,"Quests usually have an assigned landmark that is JUST for that quest, so quitting a quest should remove it from the map. Instead, it is kept on the map and has no effect when visited.",,
--,Guild should complain in thetrader if you make too much money off of guild items,Low,--,no,Working,"Small detail. Reselling guild items has a potential of being pretty profitable. All guild items should have itemdata.fromGuild = true to be tagged. If the player makes over 10k from guild items, a guildmaster will come to them to complain and warn them. If they make another 10k, they have a 50% chance to get banned from teh guild",,

--,Different accolades should unlock different color palettes for the graphics version,Low,--,no,pending,,,

closed issues,,,,,,,,
--,Need a battle tutorial,Medium,--,no,Done,"The battle system is one of the only things in the game that is hard to penetrate just by exploring. It would be helpful to have a ""battle tutorial""","FINALLY done. Its a book that, when read, starts an auto-battle tutorial with a chance to try things while teaching the basics. It is accessible through the sentimental box",
,,,,,,,,
--,Mysterious crash of a battle art phantom,Low,no,yes,Done?,"Baph reported a crash after improving items (full report: "" error upon backing out of a item selection menu for item improvement after already improving a few items.""), but it looks like the crash is from a resolved Art usage in battle. My guess is that a previous in-battle crash occurred but was recovered from, and the art usage was waiting until a clear window queue.","Ive set up an explicit error for when this case comes up again. It hasnt happened for 2 version ups, so im marking this as fixed for now",
--,"On battle start, listing effects becomes tiring late-game",Medium,--,no,Done,When you have a lot of equips you kinda have to scroll through effects on each battle start,Now all initial effects are grouped together and displayed at once,
--,Life crystals dont break after use,Medium,yes,yes,Done,Birb reported enemies reviving multiple times from clones that had life crystals,"The unequipping of an item only removed innate effects, which was incorrect. Now unequipping mid battle (or losing equipment mid battle) will properly remove effects",
--,Crash on quick save when NPCs are involved,Medium,yes,yes,Done,In a dungeon? Need to quick save? dont do it if theres a specialty shop!,"The saving system now supports rudimentary ""repeats"". Before if an item was already added to the save file, it would error out if the same object was later added to save, since it could cause infinite recursion. Now, repeats are specially tagged so that they can be emplaced multiple times and still refer to the same object",
--,Quick saving taints save files,High,yes,yes,Done,"Loading a quick save puts the file into ""hard mode""",Incorrect special tag was added to quick saves that bypassed the weight emplacement and the game would think the save was tampered with. Now this special tag is removed,
--,"Adding ""seeping"" enchant to an item inflicts Frozen on the holder",High,yes,yes,Done,Incorrect enchant effect.,It was using the incorrect ID. Oopsie!,
--,Arts Energy,High,--,no,Done,Energy provides a method to combine Arts in battle. The rules of combining is that each card in game can be combined ONLY with the same energy type. Energy is assigned randomly to each drawn card.,"This overrides the old Ability leveling, now leveling simply happens with the same energy types. In addition, effects can also be combined. If an effect card is enhanced, it gains an AP counter. When a non-ability is used with AP counters, the user gains that many AP",
--,item appraisals,High,--,no,Done,"???? Items that require appraisal. Can go to shopkeep to ""roll"" and appraisal. 75G base fee and + 25 for each reroll.  ???? is only for CAN_BE_APPRAISED items. Appraised items have at least 3 enchants,a positive quality, and any material, but MUST be the same base item type. 1% chance to happen on an appraisable object",Corrected to 4% in practice. Quality and material / apparel are equal chance for any so weight is ignored and you get a pretty decent chance at something nuts,
--,Revamp Potions,High,--,no,Done,Potions need more variety to cover the basic effects that Arts rely on.,"Now potions are a base item that can have a number of buffs, debuffs/ailments, and healing. Also, potions can be mixed by alchemists, or premixed upon finding. As a bonus, Essences have been added, which is a potion that can take the form of ANY non-special effect. Alchemists abilities have been revamped to adapt to this new potion system",
--,Items are effects,High,--,no,Done,"To increase agency in battle, Item usage is now an Effect, which means many items can be used in a turn.","In conjunction with revamped AP counter /leveling system, AP management can be thought out ahead of time and adapt to a situation",
--,Loot improvement scaling needs work,Med,--,no,Done,"Right now, the loot chances for ""really good items"" (appraisables, high quality items, etc) is flat and imbalanced.","Now ""really good items"" chances of appearing scale with implicit island tier. Dev note: Tiers increase implicitly as you progress the game. Certain things may circumvent tiers, but most item qualities are outright tier-locked. These loot chances circumvented the tier check originally, but now they work in conjunction with the tier system, albeit in a different way",
--,Emphasis on Keys,Med,--,no,Done,Keys to other islands are not as immediately useful as they should be.,"To encourage Key use, the starting island has cities removed. Cities are common occurences in keyed items. In addition, other islands have their tier listed and has been modified to indefinitely increase tiers. Watch out though! Higher tier islands will be MUCH more hostile.",
--,Toggle CRT doesnt apply on startup if saved in settings,Low,yes,yes,Done,"For some reason, when settings are loaded the CRT effect setting is ignored",Incorrect handling of settings in Godot. Fixed!,
--,Lost Shrines should have better rewards,Med,--,no,Done,"With the introduction of appriasal items, the lost shrine loot is a little lackluster and doesnt encourage exploration too much","Now, the loot for lost shrines is much better. What could it be? Find out!",
--,Give those thangs feelings,Low,--,no,Done,Wouldnt it be cool if NPCs could have thoughts on their own of the world around them...,"Turns out it would! Entities now have thoughts and opinions on things. They will focus more on recent stuff, but can also have ""core memories"" which they may think about from time to time. ",
--,Revamp of window event system.,Med,--,no,Done,The current asynchronous window event system needs a rework. Too many artifacts in battles,The window event system has been simplified and handles things in a much cleaner way. Battle artifacts have been fixed,
--,New intro cutscene,Low,--,no,Done,The main intro needs some more crunch to it. Why does the Godot build have all the fun?,"boot sequence cutscene is standard across all versions of the game and has been expanded. It is skippable, of course. Added some fun little details",
--,Introducing: Audio!,Med,--,no,Done,We need some initial scaffolding for audio!,"Audio requests are now in the base code. The environment decides whether to ignore it (like in the command line version) or whether to respond to it (Godot). Similarly, the capabilities of the environment are now given to the game itself. This helps remove any unneeded settings in the game.",
--,BG/FG options?,Low,--,no,Done,It would be nice to alter the visual state of the ingame text,Added basic basic RGB colors in the settings for bg/fg,
--,Dying isnt very interesting,Med,--,no,Done,"Dying is kinda super easy to do, both intentionally and accidentally. Can we spice it up?","We indeed can. When HP is 0, this is a knockout. When hit while knocked out, this gives the ""Dying"" effect. When the effect is over and health is still 0, true death occurs. If in the dying state, simply heal to prevent death. The main interesting benefit is that with Dying as a proper effect, a lot of Arts and leverage moving the Dying state to another person",
--,Auto battling when your leader is knocked out isnt very engaging,Low,--,no,Done,"When your leader is knocked out, any other members in your party will act on their own, essentially making it autochess. While kind of neat, it really hampers the agency of the player","Now, if a leader gets knocked out, the leader is changed to someone else. Whats neat about this is its still a penalty, as the one changed to the leader is unlikely the one you WANT to be leader, AND you cant change leaders mid battle. It creates some interesting dynamics",
--,Life crystal access,Low,-- ,no,Done,Life crystals are a little too rare for their usefulness,"Now, shops will sell at least one Life Crystal. Also life crystals were removed as something you can smith. You little cheaters you",
--,Multiple decks?,Med,--,no,Done,"As you gather arts, it would be nice to be able to place them into different decks to experiment.",Deck editing has been added! Should probably have some way to sort arts in the trunk though..,
--,Arts tecker buff,Low,--,no,Done,Arts tecker is a little too RNG...  only packs isnt enough,Arts tecker now sells SPECIFIC arts. These are slightly expensive but restock over night,

--,Would be nice to have a favoriting system,Low,--,no,Done,Baph-board:It can get hard to juggle items in inventory. A tagging / favoriting system would be nice,,
--,Cant remove profession arts,High,yes,yes,Done,Removing arts from professions results in a crash,Now it doesnt!,
--,Battle crash when AIs choose what to do,High,yes,yes,Done?,AI battle choices sometimes return incorrect items causing a hard-to-find crash,The problem is that the ai battle checking algorithms which are custom per art can sometimes have mistakes where the return value from them is invalid. This has been patched,
--,Stacking items,Low,--,no,Done,"Certain items, such as potions, should be stackable. Stackability should just affect how the items are displayed in an item list when applicable",,
--,Loading a different island of a previously saved file causes a crash,High,yes,yes,Done,"This is caused by the new weight checking, only present in the alpha given out to birb",,
--,"When stunned and otherwise, can still react and do certain battle things.",High,yes,yes,Done,"When stunned, certain actions are still available, like reacting to arts. This is surprisingly and potentially confusing\",Patched. Now most battle contexts will check if the users turn was cancleed by an effect and use that data to see whether to respond and do certain things (i.e. reactions),
--,Multiturn actions cause a crash,High,yes,no,Done,"When the repeat action is cast, a crash occurs due to mismatching arguments",Multiturn actions were hanlded incorrectly and hadnt been touched since the arts changeover. Now it should work,
--,"Crash from known art ""flags""",High,yes,yes,Done,Crash from invalid attribute access,"Typo from changing ""flags"" into ""traits"" for consistency",
--,Crash from missing base:ailment,High,yes,yes,Done,Crash from trying to process base:ailment as an arts term,Typo. Its supposed to be base:ailments,
--,Crash from missing base:freezing,High,yes,yes,Done,Freezing effect is missing,"Typo. Was set to ""frozen""",
--,Descriptions are sometimes grammatically incorrect.,High,yes,yes,Done,"Missing / extra artles ""they have a fur which is""",System was too basic. Now it accounts for this properly,
--,Drops need some work,High,--,no,Done,Finishing a fight has too many prompts,"Loot was offloaded to bodies, like from ""squabbles"". Now every defeated dungeon being will reduce to a body if theyre not ethereal (like the specter)",
0.1.9a - e87b63e,Ice not working sometimes,Low,no,yes,Done?,None yet. Keeping an eye out. Could be related to  multihit cancelling,This may have been inadvertently fixed. It has not reappeared for quite a few versions,
0.1.9a - e87b63e,AP disappears from party,Medium,no,yes,Done?,used wait twice and sunbeam and all the party AP was gone?,This may have been inadvertently fixed. It has not reappeared for quite a few versions,

--,Blood's Ward chooses a target when the target isnt used,High,yes,yes,Done,"The art is meant to just cancel, so it choosing a target is a mistake",Just was set to target mode ONE instead of target mode NONE,
--,Fountains heal AP too,High,yes,yes,Done,Fountains heal AP when AP healing outside of battle doesnt make sense,Layover from when AP was preserved. All patched,
--,Banishing light marked as a BUFF,High,yes,yes,Done,Banishing light is incorrectly marked as a buff,Changed to be debuff,
--,Banishing light is broken,High,yes,yes,Done,"Banishing light both persists and its banish stacks dont seem to ""stick"" for some reason","Removing effects via a filter actually worked in reverse, so this and a bunch of others were broken. Fixed now.",
--,Intuition growing is so out of left field. Can we get something else?,High,--,no,Done,Intuition growth feels a bit too random. Can we achieve the same thing in a natural way?,"The idea of growth over time is going to be accomplished with ""weapon growth"". Instead of a 10% chance for all parties weapons to gain a stat (intuition of the weapon), now each battle has a 50% chance to proc ONE of the party member's weapon's increase of stats. This makes the accolade pretty trivial if you dont avoid all battles.",
--,"Easier description accessibility with ""keyword"" specificity.",High,--,no,Done,"For arts descriptions, often other key terms are referenced. If there was a keyword dictionary where a description work matched a reference word, we could provide a quick way to see what it means. It would be especially nice if the descriptions had a ""keyword hint"" character, such as $ which will signify when such terms are present.","All Arts that refer to effects have part of their generated display the list of the effect. In addition, any general terms that require more definition are also included (such as what constitutes a status ailment)",
--,Formal notification system for Arts and Effects,High,--,no,Done,"Until now, Arts and Effects are completely wild-west when it comes to informing the user. I propose that 1) effects have in their database a Start and End message string to let the players know that theyre there or gone and 2) that Arts have a commit and fail message string. The regularity will help prevent confusing situations for new arts and effects and how they play in-game","Arts now have a ""greeting"" and ""fail"" message. Effects may or may not ""greet"" the user, but they will always have an HUD displaying if an effect was gained or lost with details on the effect displayed.",
--,Cant back out of arts tecker,High,yes,yes,Done,"Baph-board: cant back out of Arts Tecker when you have enough money. You can select ""no"" but you cant cancel out of it.",Fixed. Now you can cancel or say no,
--,Can back out of item improving,High,yes,yes,Done,"Baph-board: after leveling a weapon, you can back out of the stat choosing menu","Fixed. Now you must choose a stat. Cant ignore destiny, after all",

--,Reactions can still be used by people who are unable to act,High,yes,yes,Done,This shouldnt be allowed...,Reaction logic for NPCs was done BEFORE checking if theyre dead. Whoopsie!,
--,Proliferate / Proliferate All doesnt stack properly,High,yes,yes,Done,Proliferate* adds paralysis instead of duplicating the effect,,
--,Shops always contain whatever they initially have,High,--,no,Done,Shops (and locations in general) should be more dynamic and refresh their stock every day,"Im adding an optional ""hourly tick"" for all locations, for which custom ones can have events happen every hour. Shops can then use this to implement restocking. Time only happens on a visiting island. Probably will have time fast-forward when revisiting an island",
--,"Instigating guards at areas that dont have guards still shows the ""guards are approaching"" message without any guards",High,yes,yes,Done,"Aggressive landmark? check. Guards? Nope. Problem? Yeah, i keep perceiving guards but they never reach me","The scene for guards attacking is prefaced by ""several guards approach with haste"" but the check for if there are guards does not happen until after this message is displayed. This is now fixed",
--,Meeting someone in the wilderness and incapacitating them still displays you thanking them,High,yes,yes,Done,"If you get into a fight with a rando, it doesnt make sense to thank them afterward even if its funny","No matter the cause, you always thank them. Now, you simply walk away from their body if you incapacitate them",
--,Some talking instances have a greeting when it doesnt make sense,High,yes,yes,Done,BBQ interaction and Taverns have people greet you when they shouldnt in these cases,Now the default greeting is skipped since theyre supplanted with context-specific stuff!,
--,Landmarks on the map are a little hard to see,High,--,no,Done,"So many symbols, with more coming... How are we going to see landmarks? Currently, there is a ""space"" made around a landmark, but its not enough in most cases",,
--,"Items that dont have a size will say ""It is smaller than expected""",High,yes,yes,Done,Thought this was fixed before! But i guess not. This should be removed from descriptions if its not relevant to the item (the item has no size),"Turns out this was due to a failsafe of preventing ""bad sizes"" from creeping in. The default value for something that doesnt have a size is ""small"". Now it is properly checked!",
--,Fighting the Treasure Golem results in a crash,High,yes,yes,Done,Crash in treasure golem from discarding an empty hand,"Basic attacks accidentally discarded a random card, a layover from an early AI implementation. Now patched!",
--,Rewards for beating wyverns,High,--,no,Done,Need rewards now for beating wyverns since they are at the end of a shrine,They give perfect arts crystal effects (rare and epic arts only),
--,Need more reasons to visit additional islands,High,--,no,Done,We need worthwhile rewards for exploring,"Mines have been expanded to give MUCH more ore. Lost shrines can now give perfect arts crystals, which are not attainable in any other way (unless a user goes exploring-crazy). Lost shrines are now only explorable once.",
--,Soft locking with keys,High,--,no,Done,"With the new island organization, its a lot easier to soft lock yourself","For both scenarios, you are given home keys that are ""key items"" meaning they cant be sold / tossed / etc. Similar, in The Chosen, the Wyvern keys are also ""key items""",
--,Hired people dont have enough arts to meet the default threshold of cards in decks,High,yes,yes,Done,"When you hire someone, the default cards are not enough to satisfy the editor requirement, and since you cant back out of the menu, there is a fair chance of softlock",Default decks are now more stable,
--,Reactions cannot currently choose targets,High,yes,yes,Done,Reactions default to targets which limits the use of certain arts.,Fixed. This came with some other changes to reaction arts,
--,Incapacitated people can react (and cause other shenanigans),High,yes,yes,Done,Poor handling of reactions,Fixed so it. doesnt do that!,
0.2.0 - 0512722d0,Adding / removing arts from a deck can mess with the order of whats selectable vs what is visible in the deck editing menu,High,yes,yes,Done,UUGGHHH the entries in the choices list dont correspond exactly to whats being displayed after a few things are added/removed. A refresh needs to happen that is currently not happening. Should be slight,"The list of categories within the pickArt function was not cleared, so it would misreport clicks within the menu sometimes. Im lucky i came across an easily repeatable case!",
--,Wyvern keys are a bit confusing...,Medium,--,no,Done,"Its a silly detail but the wyvern keys are.... strange and they dont make much sense if youre not a programmer. Using the wyvern keys on a gate takes you to the wyvern dimension, but the keys themselves point to a real island that the wyverns take you to. Which is silly because if you want to revisit the island you need to hop to the wyvern FIRST before they send you back.This is purely from a storytelling/environment perspective; they work just fine as they are, but it can be kinda clunky","The wyvern keys should ONLY point to the wyvern dimension. After defeating a wyvern, they should give you a key to an island for the shrine for the next wyvern",
0.2.0 - 0512722d0,counter not blocking attack,Medium,yes,yes,Done,no message popping up as usual for counter; effect still persisted on fighter afterwards.,Not uh sure. This seems to have fixed itself...,
--,In-battle effect display needs work,Medium,--,no,Done,"In battle effect display only shows a simple list of effect + description. This should be swapped for a more Arts-list like display where the effect is itemized on a list with a renderable that shows how long it has, a description, etc. Also need to make sure this list is viewable for enemies as well. IN ADDITION: baphy suggested characters in the HUD for the character. Im leaning more on symbols, but we'll see",Symbols added and tallied when effects are present. Effect list is much more accessible and detailed,
0.2.0 - 0512722d0,certain effects like Stun which last 1 turn end too early,Medium,yes,yes,Done,"The logic for effect duration recently changed to better fit certain situations, and now single turn stuff ends early. Should be a quick fix, just gotta do it!",Effect turn counting is now PER CHARACTER rather than PER GLOBAL TURN. This makes effects much more straightforward (meaning Turns that This Character Experiences rather than The Current Turn of Combat),
0.1.9a - e87b63e,Cursed Summoning does not have the Cursed part,High,yes,yes,Done,"User of cursed summoning was ""cured"" of the curse, which bypasses the whole point of the art. Augh","The curse was applied /before/ the summon joined battle, so when it joined battle, all status effects were removed",
0.1.9a - e87b63e,Multihit ability cancelled after a target died,medium,yes,yes,Done,"I think what is happening is that the multihit attack ORIGINALLY targetted the dead person, so nothing happens once they died. I can have an alternate display for this case.","When hitting a dead target, currently the attack is cancelled. This is incorrect on 2 levels, first any hit effect should proc even when hitting a dead target. Second, the hit landing, if it does land, should be displayed to the user in some way.",

--,Seedable RNG world generation,Medium,--,no,Done,"In procedurally generated games, it is often helpful to have seedable world generation","Added! Though, the rng is used for EVERYTHING not just world generation, so it can diverge. Still, it should help speedrunners if there are any",
0.2.0 - 0512722d0,improperly placed improvement stat point.,High,yes,yes,Done,"claimed to put a stat point into spd, once picked, but the actual stat information and the change window displays the point allocating to luk instead.

0.2.0 - 0512722d0,Improvement number not shown,Medium,yes,yes,Done,"When improving an item with a custom name, the improvement +# is not shown",Corrected! Now both this and the enchantment count should be shown,
--,Better arts deck handling,High,--,no,Done,Baph and rasa discussion about this,"The following will be changed: 25 deck charge minimum based on rarities.  To bolster this, we need more starting arts for players to play around with. Skill Crystals need an upgrade, so  those can be ""booster packs"". Give one in sentimental box",
--,Better profession handling,High,-- ,no,Done,Baph and rasa discussion about this,Professions will now be handled differently. Each person can have up to 5 profession arts equipped. Professions acquire levels through EXP in battle and level at a flat rate i.e. 5 battles to level to level 3. Each level gains a new professive skill for that profession. This adds it to the pool of possible arts available to be equipped by that person.,
--,Profession separation,High,--,no,Done,"Some professions should be treated differently, as non-combat professions. These wont grow from battle EXP","Deciding between a couple different avenues: Either A) having all non-combat professions either be All Learned or B) Learned through special teaching instances: UPDATE: schools will be the only place to learn non-combat professions. In addition, non combat professions are more expensive to learn and immediately teach you all abilities",

0.1.9a - e87b63e,Assassin reacts overpowered,Medium,--,no,Done,The damage counts on the assassin abilities are NOT balanced despite the single-use nature of them.,"Each attack is only allowed one use per turn, which was bugged before. Also damage was drastically reduced.",
0.1.9a - e87b63e,Item Improvement check,medium,--,no,Done,Baphy and Rasa discussion happening on this.,"Item improvements now happen with base stats rather than adding percentages. They also use an EXP system which scales up as improvements are made. Because of the potential for increase stat bases, the difficulty at later tiers of the game were increased",
0.1.9a - e87b63e,Re-evaluate crits,High,--,no,Done,predicted damage of 1-2 critted for 28. Too much?,The crit damage was based on LUK too heavily. Now LUK is only involved in the actual crit chance calculation only. The damage is bumped up to a minimum of 3 and is x2.5 ,

0.1.9a - e87b63e,Too many enchants... Minor enchants basically useless,Low,--,no,Done,Minor crystals are too common and dilute the power of enchantments,"Less is more. General enchantment rate (such as stores) are now decreased. All minor crystal enchantments have been removed. In its stead, a ""minor aura"" was added as a tier 0 enchantment which slightly boosts all stats including AP and HP. Enchantment stands in dungeons have been decreased in appearance from ""always there"" to ""there from time to time""",

0.1.9a - e87b63e,"Crash when ""squabbles"" involve effects",Medium,yes,yes,Done?,"When NPCs fight each other (AKA ""squabble"") they never enter battle, so a ficticious ""fake battle"" is set up. The fake battle breaks when an NPC successfully gives another a status effect","I fixed and found the source, but will have a hard time double-checking it. So ill just consider it closed unless it comes up again.",
0.1.9a - e87b63e,Can have more than 3 party members,Low,no,yes,Done,There are certain circumstances where this can happen,Skie is the problem. Their joining doesnt do the usual party size checking. This has been patched.,
0.1.9a - e87b63e,Level abilities upgrade are miscounted ,High,yes,yes,Done,level 2 + level 1 = level 4? Huh? probably wrong order used.,Was a simple mishandling: was adding the level of the chosen card to itself rather than the one being discarded Should be resolved now,
0.1.9a - e87b63e,Drinks at the tavern heal AP when AP doesnt persist outside of battle anymore,Low,yes,yes,Done,No more details needed! simple fix,AP healing was removed from the tavern.,
0.1.9a - e87b63e,Gamblist missing supports,High,yes,yes,Done,Every entity cannot have fewer then 5 supports,"There were missing initial supports, so some starter ones were added.",
--,"When NPCs are defeated by other NPCs, their bodies go to a random location",Medium,yes,yes,Done,"Annoying! Random bodies appear in locations that are impossible, but it seems like the source squabbles are legit","Incorrect parameters when creating the bodies, x/y were given random values",
--,Infinite recursion when Wyvern of Ice takes their turn in the dice game,High,yes,yes,Done,"after they make their first roll and presumably make a comment on it, an infinite recursive loop occurs in the windowEvent handler","This one could point to additional needs to learn, but has been resolved",
--,High level enemies have way too much AP,High,--,no,Done,AP is a valuable resources that determines the flow of battle. Only special enemies should have more than normal,Entities now have 8 to 14 AP and no longer gain AP per level. This makes unique NPCs like wyverns inherently more dangerous,
--,Teleporting to another island in The Chosen makes the first frame incorrect,Low,yes,yes,Done,first frame is in island view rather than at the gate until first input.,"cursorMove modes waited on next input to apply pending window events, now they just do it immediately. Given that cursorMoves are so passive, this naturally folds in well with the rest of the program and should resolve some visual wonkiness as well",
--,"Sometimes when the battle menus resize, the previously drawn frame is kept",Low,yes,yes,Done,REALLY annoying issue. The battle rendering stack is a little complex so ive been putting it off;,Turn out to be fixed by the fix for the issue with first frame being incorrect when teleporting,
